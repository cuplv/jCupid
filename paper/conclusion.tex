Timing based side-channels are a matter of great concern when developing 
secure programs.
We hope that \jcupid can aid developers in testing and detecting side-channels
in program during development. 
In order to find the side channels, \jcupid  tracks the sequence of bytecodes
that are executed for multiple inputs of the same size.
Once two inputs are found that cause a different sequence of bytecodes to be
executed, \jcupid can inform the developer of the line that caused the
divergence.
We show that in this way \jcupid can detect side channel bugs using a series of
case studies (and we show that \jcupid does not detect bugs in the corrected
versions). 
 
\jcupid is intended to be used by developers to test very specific aspects of
their code.
Running \jcupid on even moderately sized  projects---say an authentication
server---will most certainly find different bytecodes executed based on input
(even of the same length).
\jcupid is intended as a more precise tool--instead of analyzing the whole
server, the tool is intended to analyze whether the crucial parts of the program
(such as modular exponentiation function) execute different bytecodes for inputs
of the same size (and thus for instance reveals information about bits in the
secret key).
