In order to test jCupid we wrote a series of sample tests, some which depend on user input, others not. The ones that depend on user input vary on how the execution depends on the input. Some are very direct, testing the input directly, the more interesting examples depend on aspects of the input, such as the length or the sum of the characters etc.

jCupid runs quickly, the time is evenly spent between finding inputs which produce different hash outputs and then cross-referencing to get the line number. Since the strings that are selected are random the runtime of the program can vary, sometimes finding inputs quickly other times not.
