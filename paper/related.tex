%% Attacks
Side-channel attacks are the class of attacks on cryptographic system that
attempt to gain information about a system by by exploiting involuntary
information leaks via physical properties---
such as temperature, electromagnetic leaks, memory footprints, and timing
delays---of the implementation rather than using brute force or exploiting
theoretical weakness of the algorithm.
For our tool we focus on timing based information leaks in systems
implemented in software. 
Some notable examples of timing-based information leaks include \emph{padding oracle
attack}~\cite{Vau02}, \emph{Lucky-13 attack}~\cite{al2013lucky},  Modular
exponentiation algorithm employed in Diffie-Hellman, RSA, and
DSS~\cite{kocher96}.

A na\"ive remedy to timing-based information leaks in software-implemented
systems is to make the software run in fixed time for all possible inputs by
introducing timers to delay the observable outputs. 
However, it is quite difficult to ensure in practice, and moreover the often CPU
usage may also leak information in this situation. 
Transcript security model by Molnar et al.~\cite{Molnar05} is another way
to minimize information leak by requiring that for all confidential inputs, the
observable outputs (sequence of program counter values or opcodes) are
statistically indistinguishable.
In our work, we propose an automatic testing framework to test whether a given
Java program is transcript secure where transcripts are Java Bytecode
instructions.
Our framework, with some efforts, can be extended to more general notions of
transcripts.

The idea monitoring executed bytecodes is not dissimilar to that of finding all
of the paths through a program. This led us to many concolic testers and input
fuzzers.  

In particular jFuzz~\cite{jayaraman2009jfuzz}, a concolic whitebox input fuzzer,
built on the NASA Java PathFinder. The goal of jFuzz is to start from a given
seed and using this find inputs which lead down all possible paths of a given
program. As mentioned this goal is not completely perpendicular to our own, and
finding which inputs lead down unique paths is valuable information. This
project however was difficult to get running, as it requires Java 1.5, and
seemingly does not work with Java 1.8. 

Additionally another concolic tester, jCute~\cite{conf/cav/SenA06} allowed us to
use more recent versions of Java. While jCute was a promising tool we found that
that for some of our test programs jCute did not recognize various paths in our
program. 

Also OpenJDK~\cite{OpenJDK} provided us with the ability to look at executed
bytecodes. The key word here being \emph{executed} bytecodes, there are numerous
static analyzers that allow the user to examine the bytecode information of
their code~\cite{vallee1999soot}. However a bytecode (or timing) difference can
occur in a library call and as such we need to dynamically analyze bytecodes
that are executed on each run. The OpenJDK project is an open-source version of
Oracle's JDK. This was key for jCupid due to certain flags for the JDK
(\texttt{-XX:+TraceBytecodes}) are only allowed in develop versions of the JDK,
compiled with a debug flag. The release version of the JDK does not allow the
use of this flag, however compiling OpenJDK with the debug flag allowed us
access to dynamically executed bytecodes. Listing~\ref{lst:ex} shows an example
of code in which bytecode differences will occur not in the source code but in a
library call. The \texttt{SumRandomBytes} program will read a string from the
user and then sum the bytes of the characters. This sum gives the number of
bytes to read from a file which are then hashed. The hash function will do
different amounts of work based on the given input string. 

The above projects are great tools, but do not solve the problem at hand, which
is to pinpoint which bytecode, or line of code causes a program do different
work for different inputs. This is what jCupid attempts to help solve with the
aid, or incite of the above projects.
